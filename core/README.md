# WynkJS Core Philosophy

## üéØ Lightweight & Flexible

**WynkJS does NOT try to be everything.** We provide:

### ‚úÖ What's Included

- **Decorators** - @Controller, @Get, @Post, @Body, @Param, etc.
- **Guards** - Route protection and authorization
- **Pipes** - Input validation and transformation
- **Interceptors** - Request/response modification
- **Filters** - Error handling
- **DTO Validation** - Using Elysia's built-in TypeBox
- **Database Helpers** - initializeDatabase() and getDatabase() (optional)

### ‚ùå What's NOT Included

- Heavy ORM abstractions
- Forced database libraries
- Complex configuration systems
- Unnecessary dependencies
- Bloated features you don't need

## üöÄ Why This Approach?

1. **Performance** - 20x faster than NestJS (Elysia's speed)
2. **Flexibility** - Use ANY database library you want
3. **Simplicity** - Learn once, use anywhere
4. **Small Bundle** - No unnecessary code
5. **Freedom** - You're not locked into our choices

## üìö Database Integration

We provide **example patterns** you can copy, not forced implementations.

### Option 1: Use Our Helper (Recommended)

```typescript
import { initializeDatabase, getDatabase } from "@wynkjs/framework";

const db = initializeDatabase({ type: "postgres", connectionString, schema });
// Use anywhere: const db = getDatabase();
```

### Option 2: Create Your Own Pattern

Copy examples from `core/database.ts` and customize to your needs.

### Option 3: Use Your Existing Code

WynkJS doesn't force you to change anything. Keep using your existing database patterns!

## üí° Philosophy

> **"Give developers the tools they need, not the bloat they don't."**

We focus on making decorators and middleware work beautifully with Elysia.
Everything else? **You decide.**
